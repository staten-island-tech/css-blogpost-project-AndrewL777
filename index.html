            The Yellow Prime Vandal is the best vandal skin in the game. The
            yellow/black colors match very well, the shots sound satisfying, the
            reload is smooth, and the finisher is sick. Every single variant looks nice as well, so the skin is just full of value.

            The Blue RGX Vandal falls short to the Prime.
            The design is very clean, the kill counter is a nice edition, and being able to adjust the colors mid-game is really convenient. 
            However, the gun lacks a special reload animation, which is why it is ranked below the Prime.

        <p>3. Gold Forsaken</p>

        </a>
        <div class="paragraph"><p>
       The Gold Forsaken skin has such a nice design. The gun looks very sharp, which is fitting for something as powerful as the vandal. The sound effects made when equipping the gun sound holy, which matches the soverign aspect perfectly. 
       The color scheme is also really great. Unfortunately, with no special sounding shots and the default reloading animation, the gun just doesn't feel as special as the RGX. Some honorable mentions for the third spot include the Reaver, Neptune, and Sentinels of Light.
